Query Drift Prevention for Robust Query Expansion
ABSTRACT
The automatic query expansion retrieval based on pseudo-
relevance feedback(also known as the blind-relevance feed-
back) performs effectively on average, but the performance
is inferior to that of using the original query for many infor-
mation needs. Further, the average precision(MAP) score
for a query, dwindles on using the query expansion based on
pseudo-relevance feedback. The important cause for this ro-
bustness decrease(the plummeting MAP score for a query),
that is, the query drift problem, would be attempted to be
solved. The method used to ameliorate the query drift prob-
lem, is by the fusion of the results retrieved in response to
the original query and to its expanded form. This fusion-
based approach produces a retrieval performance, which is
better than that of retrieval based only on the original query
and a more robust performance(the improvement in the av-
erage precision per query) than that of retrieval using the
expanded query.
